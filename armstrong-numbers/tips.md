Well done on this creative solution!

Firstly, you could implement your own exp function using repeat and apply to avoid the import (this might also be kinda fun).

Secondly, I think that the spirit of this exercise is to avoid turning the number into a string and then to a vector. Is there a way you could keep it as a number and get its digits using iterate, take-while, quot and mod?
